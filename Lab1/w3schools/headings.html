<!--Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

For example:

<h1> - Page title
<h2> - Section titles
<h3> - Sub-sections
